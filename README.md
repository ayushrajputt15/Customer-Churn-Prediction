# Customer-Churn-Prediction
A machine learning project where I built a customer churn prediction model using XGBoost on real-world bank data.  
The goal was to accurately classify whether a customer will leave the bank (churn) based on their account details.

## 📊 Features

- Preprocessed data using one-hot encoding and standard scaling
- Trained a high-performance XGBoost classifier without using logistic regression
- Achieved ~85% accuracy with strong ROC-AUC performance
- Visualized actual vs predicted churn using a line chart
- Evaluated results using confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC-AUC

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python  
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, XGBoost
